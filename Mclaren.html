      <h1>Learn more about Mclaren</h1>
      <p>McLaren was founded in 1963 by New Zealand racing 
        driver Bruce McLaren, originally as a motorsport 
        team before expanding into road cars. The brand 
        is best known for its cutting-edge engineering and 
        Formula 1 dominance, but when it comes to road cars, 
        the McLaren F1 is often considered its most legendary
        model. Launched in the 1990s, the F1 held the record 
        for the world’s fastest production car for years.
        The most expensive McLaren ever sold is
        the McLaren F1 LM-Specification, which went 
        for $19.8 million at auction. McLaren
        continues to push boundaries with hypercars like the
        P1 and the Speedtail.  Unlike Ferrari, McLaren 
        doesn’t restrict who can buy their cars, but their 
        top-tier models still remain ultra-exclusive due 
        to their high price tags and limited production numbers.</p>
