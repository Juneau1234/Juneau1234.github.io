      <h1>Learn more about Pagani</h1>
      <p>Pagani was founded in 1992 by Horacio Pagani, 
        an Argentine-Italian engineer with a passion
        for creating the ultimate hypercars. Unlike 
        brands with decades of history, Pagani quickly
        made a name for itself with its first model,
        the Zonda, which came out in 1999 and became 
        an instant hit. Today, the Pagani Huayra is 
        one of the brandâ€™s most well-known models, 
        featuring a twin-turbo V12 engine and stunning 
        craftsmanship. The most expensive Pagani ever
        sold is the Pagani Zonda HP Barchetta, which
        went for around $17.5 million. Pagani 
        is known for its obsessive attention to detail, 
        hand-crafted interiors, and limited production 
        runs, often making only a handful of each model.
        Unlike mass-production supercar brands, every 
        Pagani is a true work of art, blending extreme 
        performance with unmatched luxury.</p>
