      <h1>Learn more about Ferrari</h1>
      
      <p> Ferrari was officially founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari, 
        but it wasnâ€™t until 1947 that the first car with the Ferrari 
        name, the 125 S, was made. Over the years, Ferrari has built 
        some of the most iconic sports cars in history, with the Ferrari 
        F40 being its most legendary and popular model. 
        The most expensive Ferrari ever sold is the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, 
        which went for a crazy $70 million in a private sale. Ferrari is 
        also known for its limited-production hypercars, like 
        the LaFerrari, which combines a V12 engine with hybrid 
        technology for insane performance. Even today, Ferrari 
        is a symbol of speed, luxury, and exclusivity, with
        some of its rarest cars only available to a hand-picked group of buyers. </p>
